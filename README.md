This project is made entirely using c++ and the SFML multi-media library.
This project includes *POTENTIALLY* 5 different sorting algorithms to choose from, including the ability to adjust the number of bars to sort, and the speed at which they are sorted.

Press _SPACE_ to begin the sort

Press _1 2 3 4 5_ to choose the algorithms
